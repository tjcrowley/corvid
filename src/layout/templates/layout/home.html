          <h2>Why Corvid?</h2>
          <p>In Norse mythology, the all-father Odin relied upon two ravens (from the family Corvidae) to be his eyes ears and most imporantantly his messengers.  Their names were Huginn and Muninn, which translated to "Thought" and "Mind" in Old Norse.  They were capable of flying all over the world from morning until evening when they reported back to the All-Father, keeping him abreast of all the events of the day.  Among other things, Odin was a trickster, a tale spinner and the powerful leader of the Norse pantheon.  In modern times he would undoubtedly be patron of the Media and of course live video streaming.  When we were working on a name, the portmanteau of "Corporate" and "Video" was suggested by a team member and the name hung in the air as if one of Odin's ravens was whispering a timeless secret.  Given the powerful symbology, we thought it fitting that Corvid be our name and that we harness the power of those ancient ravens to deliver your messages faithfully at incredible speed.</p>
